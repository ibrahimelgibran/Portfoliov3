      <p class="mt-5">The next explanation for the code above is: Just setup for development mode, for example in local, when there is a change in the code, you can run it directly via Docker.</p>
      <p class="mt-3">The explanation of the code is:</p>
      <p><strong>→ FROM : </strong>images from where, for example, initiating a project so you can use it from node:16 can be read in docker hub node.</p>
      <p><strong>→ WORKDIR : </strong>when it reaches the contest it will immediately initiate which is free in this case I entered it in /usr/app.</p>
      <p><strong>→ COPY . . : </strong>To copy from the current local directory to the container and in this case everything will be copied in this folder. Example: COPY. . (Resource walkway and destination point).</p>
      <p><strong>→ RUN npm install : </strong>I want to run a sample comment.</p>
      <p><strong>→ EXPOSE 3000 : </strong>Next, expose the port that is running on the express.</p>
      <p><strong>→ CMD [“nam”, “start”] : </strong>The last comment you want to make is to run the app.</p>
      <p class="mt-2">This is the configuration for generating images for docker.</p>
      <p class="mt-5"><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
      <p class="mt-3">This is so that the Docker container can, in other words, watch local changes, it's called a volume, it can sort of synchronize. Still using the image configuration that was created earlier.</p>
      <p class="mt-2">Next build the app:</p>
      <p><strong>$ docker build . -t ieg-run</strong></p>
       <img class="mt-2" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/elgibran/run%20docker/Screenshot%202024-07-02%20at%2019.40.10.png?updatedAt=1719924517805" alt="build-docker">  
      <p class="mt-5">Check the build results:</p>
      <p><strong>$ docker images</strong></p>
      <p class="mt-5">The images are ready, just run as a container:</p>

      <p>You can search with the command: <strong>$ pwd</strong> </br> Then hassel : /Users/elgibran17/Documents/Dekstop/myapp</p>
      <p class="mt-5">Then when you want to run the container.</p>
      <p>add the volume:<strong> $ docker run --volume=/Users/elgibran17/Documents/Dekstop/myapp:/usr/app -p 3000:3000 -d ieg-run</strong></br>Note: add the destination:/usr/app</p>
      <p class="mt-5">View running containers:</p>
      <p><strong>$ docker ps</strong></p>
      <p class="mt-5">Additionally, you can also use it via the Docker desktop application. </br>Example:</p>
      <p>Open run images, input volumes or host path and destination or container path.</p>
      <img class="mt-2" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/elgibran/run%20docker/Screenshot%202024-07-02%20at%2019.46.46.png?updatedAt=1719924520410" style="height:400px" alt="run-forapps">

      <p class="mt-5"><strong>In conclusion, </strong>Docker helps run applications in containers without the need for a separate physical or virtual server. For example, commands like npm start can be run in a Docker container, which makes them very useful for running programs and applications quickly and consistently across different environments. Docker allows developers to package an application and all its dependencies into a single standard unit that can be run anywhere.</p>

    content: `
      <p>Do you want to implement OAuth2 login in your Java applications but feel overwhelmed by the complexity? Look no further! we'll take a quick look at the world of OAuth2 authentication using Spring Boot and Spring Security.</p>
      <p class="mt-5" style="font-weight: bold;">Step 1</p>
      <p>First, we install the package from <a style="font-weight: bold" href="https://start.spring.io/">start.spring.io</a> if it is already open. we need to setup spring boot packages, do the same as this.</p>
      <img class="mt-5" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/elgibran/Screenshot%202024-06-27%20at%2008.11.57.png?updatedAt=1719450739801" alt="Spring Boot">
      <p class="mt-5">For the Java version, you can adapt it to the one you use on your OS device. Then add the "Spring Web" and "OAuth Client" dependencies, if so, create them.</p>

      <p class="mt-5" style="font-weight: bold;">Step 2</p>
      <p>A controller in a Spring Boot application that handles HTTP requests and provides responses.</p>
      <img class="mt-2" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/elgibran/Screenshot%202024-06-27%20at%2016.00.32.png?updatedAt=1719478840792" alt="file HomeController">

        <code>
package dev.iegcode.sosial_login.controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ExceptionHandler;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.ModelAndView;

# Class Declaration
@RestController
public class HomeController {
→ Declare the HomeController class as a RESTful controller.

    # Home Method
    @GetMapping("/")
    public String home() {
        return "Hello, Home!";
    }
    → This method maps the GET request to the root path ("/") </br>      and returns the string "Hello, Home!" in response.

    # Secured Method
    @GetMapping("/secured")
    public String secured() {
        return "Hello, Secured!";
    }
    → This method maps the GET request to the /secured path and </br>      returns the string "Hello, Secured!" in response.

    # Login Method
    @GetMapping("/login")
    public String login() {
        return "Please login!";
    }
    → This method maps the GET request to the path /login </br>      and returns the string "Please login!" in response.

    # Exception Handler
    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public ModelAndView handleException(Exception ex) {
        ModelAndView mav = new ModelAndView();
        mav.addObject("exception", ex);
        mav.setViewName("error");
        return mav;
    }
    → This method handles exceptions that occur in </br>      the controller. If there is an exception, this method </br>      swill create a ModelAndView object, add an exception (ex) </br>      object to the model, set the view name to "error", </br>      and return a ModelAndView object. This allows the error </br>      view to display information about the exception</br>      that occurred.
}

        </pre>
      </div>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Conclusion</p>
      <p>The HomeController class is a simple controller in a Spring Boot application that handles HTTP GET requests to multiple endpoints (/, /secured, /login) and returns a string response. Additionally, this class also has methods to handle exceptions and redirect the user to an error page if an error occurs.</p>

      <p class="mt-5" style="font-weight: bold;">Step 3</p>
      <p>If you have handled the HTTP request and provided a response to the HomeController file. then create a new config folder with the SecurityConfig file.</p>

      <p>Conclusion The SecurityConfig class configures Spring Security web security for the application.

      <p class="mt-5" style="font-weight: bold;">Step 3</p>
      <p>This configuration sets up OAuth2 login for Spring Boot applications using GitHub, Google, and Facebook. Here is a brief explanation of each configuration line:</p>
